TODO
    sudoku generator - very hard. basically try to solve after removing stuff for single sol puzzles
    ## DONE  ##   more human like method of solving
                    store a list of possible values of each square and put the value in if only 1 available. then remove this value from the corresponding lists of squares
                    integrate both methods for faster search
    ## not needed  ##   if not previous method, randomise what/ numbers and squares to try

    create square objects
    square.hori, square.vert, square.box, square.values, 
    if a value is confirmed, remove that value from all objects from square.hori,vert,box
    how to try values that we cant confirm? (no square.values has just 1 value left):
        copy.copy() objects in a recursive function
    while removing values from square.values, check if only 1 value remaining. and maybe also 2 and 3 for priority
    maintain list of empty squares for loop (was already doing this)

    how this helps?:
        dont have to loop through all squares just to check the if it lies in same box etc
        square.values would all for checking only useful values and not check if its valid
